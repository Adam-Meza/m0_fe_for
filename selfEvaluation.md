# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel like 8/10 confident. I feel like as things get more complicated the mechanic of for statements will prove to be more and more powerful. I enjoy being able to run code on a lotof data with only a few lines. I also like that all the peramitters are set up in one line at the beginning

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
It felt good. It felt enlightening to make breakthoughs. I struggled for a while with one of the practice problems but once I figured it out it lead to a revelation in how I thought of the relationships between for statements and conditionals. So far I still feel that every struggle I've encountered has been productive either in teaching me more about the technical skills or in teachign me the meta-skill of learning how to learn, which is infinitely more important. 


- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I think I still need to learn more array call methods. I have found a few youtube accounts I really enjoy. once I'm done with assigned work I typically study the concepts that I struggled with on on my own.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I still have questions about the specfic "why"s of each containment symbol; {}, [], (), "", etc. I wanna know very specfically when to use each one.
